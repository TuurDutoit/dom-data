* Move modifiers to `$x` format, where x is the name of the modifier:
    $e: query an element
    $f: filter the output
    $m: parse manually
    $t: force type
    $a: get data from an attribute (using getAttribute)
    $p: get data from a property on the HTMLElement
* Force type: `$t: "int"` would try to parse as integer, `$t: "date"` would parse a date, etc.
* Shortcut to get data from attributes and HTMLElement properties with $a and $p, respectively
* Parsing order:
    first:
      if manual: just use that value. end.
      else:
        if has $p: get data from property
        if has $a: get data from attribute
        else: get data from textContent
    parse according to type ($t if present, otherwise guess)
    if has $f: filter value
* Shortcut for manual parsing: just pass a function, instead of {__: function($elem) {...}}
* Source object: always closest selector ($e): check if this works correctly
